Compare the distribution of 1000 exponentials

```{r}
lambda <- 0.2
n <- 1000
hist(rexp(n, lambda))
```

and the distribution of 1000 averages of 40 exponentials

```{r}
mns = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mns = c(mns, mean(rexp(40, lambda)))
hist(mns)
```

Notice how the distribution of the 1000 **averages** of random exponentials appears to be approximately normal.  Also note that its mean appears to be the mean of the 1000 generated random exponentials.

What is the sample mean of this distribution?

```{r}
mean(mns)
```
