Exponential distribution CLT
----------------------------

Compare the distribution of 1000 exponentials

```{r}
lambda <- 0.2
n <- 1000
hist(rexp(n, lambda))
```

and the distribution of 1000 averages of 40 exponentials

```{r}
mns = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mns = c(mns, mean(rexp(40, lambda)))
hist(mns)
```

Notice how the distribution of the 1000 **averages** of random exponentials appears to be approximately normal.  Also note that its mean appears to be the mean of the 1000 generated random exponentials.

Sample and theoretical means
----------------------------

What is the sample mean of the distribution?

```{r}
mean(mns)
```

The theoretical mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda:

```{r}
1/lambda
```

They differ by only

```{r}
abs(mean(mns) - 1/lambda)
```
