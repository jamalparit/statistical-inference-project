Compare the distribution of 1000 random uniforms

```{r}
hist(runif(1000))
```

and the distribution of 1000 averages of 40 random uniforms

```{r}
mns = NULL
for (i in 1 : 1000) mns = c(mns, mean(runif(40)))
hist(mns)
```

Notice how the the distribution of the 1000 generated random uniforms is wider compared to the distribution of the 100 **averages** of random uniforms
